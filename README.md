Tutorial: Using Pluto Python Wrapper to Control Your Drone
In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the steps of using the Pluto Python Wrapper to control your drone. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced enthusiast, you'll learn how to install the wrapper, utilize different control methods like keyboard, joystick, and voice commands, and troubleshoot common issues.
1. Installation
Begin by cloning the Pluto Python Wrapper repository from GitHub. Open your terminal and execute the following command:
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/csaail/Python-Wrapper.git 
2. Keyboard Control
To control your drone via the keyboard, follow these steps:
•	For Windows:
Copy code
python keyboard_test.py 
•	For Linux (Ubuntu) and MacOS:
Copy code
python keymac_test.py 
This script assigns drone commands to specific keys. For instance:
•	Press spacebar to arm or disarm the drone.
•	Use 'w' to ascend and 's' to descend.
•	Press 'q' to take off and 'e' to land.
•	Utilize 'a' to yaw left and 'd' to yaw right.
•	Arrow keys for directional movement.
3. Joystick Control
If you prefer joystick control, follow the appropriate steps based on your operating system:
•	For Windows: Make sure you have the required libraries installed, then run:
Copy code
python joystick.py 
•	For Linux (Ubuntu): Ensure you have the Evdev library installed, then execute:
Copy code
python joy_ubuntu.py 
•	For MacOS: With Pygame library installed, run:
Copy code
python joystick.py 
4. Voice Control
Control your drone using voice commands with the following steps:
•	Download a pre-trained voice model from Vosk and specify its path in voice_cmd.py.
•	Run the script:
Copy code
python voice_cmd.py 
Currently, common commands include 'hello' to arm, 'take off' to ascend, and 'land' to descend. Customize these as desired.
5. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during installation or operation, refer to the README file in the repository for troubleshooting guidance. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly and follow the instructions diligently.
